This kind of algorithm uses a training set, which is made of output depending on inputs examples, and try to produce an inferred function by analysing the training set. In this work, the perceptron only has one layer and one output. It means that all the inputs are directly connected to the output which is 1 or -1. This algorithm also uses the notion of weight.\n",
