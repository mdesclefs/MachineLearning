We had to choose and prepare two homeworks for the final exam presentation.

1) Homework #1: Questions 7, 8, 9 and 10 about the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using a synthetic dataset.

4) Homework #6: Questions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 about Overfitting and Regularization with Weight Decay. The datasets to be used are given in Homework #6.
